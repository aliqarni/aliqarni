## Hi, I'm Ali 👋

I work with data, machine learning, and analytics 📊🤖, with experience applying computational and quantitative methods to biological and real-world datasets 🧬🌍.

My interests broadly include machine learning, data analysis, and representation learning 🧠📈, and I enjoy exploring how complex datasets can be structured, visualized, and interpreted using modern computational approaches 🔍✨.

I use Python extensively 🐍 and work with tools and libraries across data science, machine learning, and scientific computing ⚙️📚.

Always learning, building, and refining projects 🚀🔬
